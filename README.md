# The Impact Project 

### Short Description

The Impact Project enables access to support the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). https://sdgs.un.org/goals

### Long  Description

The Impact Project creates a positive-sum game (all participants win) for donations supporting Sustainable Development Goals (presented by the United Nations). Donations are represented by non-transferable “Impact” tokens, which can be used to gain access to communities, games, giveaways, etc.

An individual's interests and values are represented by the assets within their crypto wallets. Creating a representation of one's societal / environmental impact within the wallet is the goal. 

The Impact Project enables NFT creators to mint an NFT with an environmental / social impact (e.g. RAC releases art where 10% of sales goes toward planting trees).

### How It's Made

Creators can define their own rules with protocols such as Zora. Contracts can now include royalties that automatically donate to charities (represented by a smart contract that produces "Impact" tokens). Quality projects are the goal and being driven in the Ethereum ecosystem through projects like https://impactio.global/.
