# The Impact Project 

### Short Description

The Impact Project enables access to support the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). https://sdgs.un.org/goals

### Long  Description

The Impact Project creates a positive-sum game (all participants win) for donations supporting Sustainable Development Goals (presented by the United Nations). Donations are represented by non-transferable “Impact” tokens, which can be used to gain access to communities, games, giveaways, etc.

An individual's interests and values are represented by the assets within their crypto wallets. Creating a representation of one's societal / environmental impact within the wallet is the goal. 

The Impact Project enables NFT creators to mint an NFT with an environmental / social impact (e.g. RAC releases art where 10% of sales goes toward planting trees).


### Use Cases 

@RAC releases a NFT with 50% of the primary and secondary market sales going towards removing plastic from the ocean.

Zora buys carbon-offset credits (https://decrypt.co/60271/zora-nft-carbon-offset-ethereum) and can prove their donation via "Impact" tokens. 

@trevorjonesart releases a 1/1 art piece and receives a bid for 10 Eth and one for 

### How It's Made

Creators can define their own rules with protocols such as Zora. Contracts can now include royalties that automatically donate to charities (represented by a smart contract that produces "Impact" tokens). Quality projects are the goal and being driven in the Ethereum ecosystem through projects like https://impactio.global/. 

*Avoid*
  - Charities that act as a black box (you don't know where your $1 donation gets allocated)

*Move Towards* 
  - Appealing to Gen Z and Millennial values
  - Incentivizing or nudging the donation to projects supporting the United Nations SDG
  - Increasing the experience of donating to a charity by leveraging token-access communities 

#### Thoughts

Social businesses (not profit-maximizing & and not reliant on donors/grants) are increasingly being spun up. How can we bring the most important global issues to the Ethereum ecosystem (future of the Creator DAO and leveraged in tokenized communities).
