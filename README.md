# The Impact Project 

### Why This is Important

The world is an unfair place, where an individual's life can be largely determined on where and when they are born. We know what problems to tackle but the infrastructure to support them isn't established within the Ethereum ecosystem. Let's build the future of the internet and tackle global problems along the way. 

### Short Description

The Impact Project enables access to support the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). https://sdgs.un.org/goals

### Long  Description

The Impact Project creates a positive-sum game (all participants win) for donations supporting Sustainable Development Goals (presented by the United Nations). Donations are represented by non-transferable “Impact” tokens, which can be used to gain access to communities, games, giveaways, etc.

An individual's interests and values are represented by the assets within their crypto wallets. Creating a representation of one's societal / environmental impact within the wallet is a benefit of "Impact" tokens.

The Impact Project enables NFT creators to mint an NFT with an environmental / social impact (e.g. RAC releases art where 10% of sales goes toward planting trees).

### Use Cases 

@RAC releases a NFT with 50% of the primary and secondary market sales going towards donating .

Zora buys carbon-offset credits (https://decrypt.co/60271/zora-nft-carbon-offset-ethereum) and can prove their donation via "Impact" tokens. 

@trevorjonesart releases a 1/1 art piece and receives a bid for 10 Eth and one for 

### How It's Made

Creators can define their own rules with protocols such as Zora. Contracts can now include royalties that automatically donate to charities (represented by a smart contract that produces "Impact" tokens). Quality projects are the goal and being driven in the Ethereum ecosystem through projects like https://impactio.global/. 

*Avoid*
  - Charities that act as a black box (you don't know where your $1 donation gets allocated)
  - Platform specific solutions (make it platformless)

*Move Towards* 
  - Appealing to Gen Z and Millennial values
  - Incentivizing or nudging the donation to projects supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
  - Increasing the experience of donating to a charity by leveraging token-access communities 

#### Thoughts

Social businesses (not profit-maximizing & and not reliant on donors/grants) are increasingly being spun up. How can we bring the most important global issues to the Ethereum ecosystem (future of the Creator DAO and leveraged in tokenized communities).
