# The Impact Project üåç

### Why This Is Important

The world is an unfair place, where an individual's life can be largely determined on where and when they are born. Supporting charitable initiatives in Ethereum should be effortless for users yet it's not. Let's build the future of the internet and tackle global problems along the way. üöÄ

### Short Description

The Impact Project enables access to support the United Nations 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). https://sdgs.un.org/goals

### Long  Description

The Impact Project creates a positive-sum game (all participants win) for donations supporting Sustainable Development Goals (presented by the United Nations). Donations are represented by non-transferable ‚ÄúImpact‚Äù tokens, which can be used to gain access to communities, games, giveaways, etc.

An individual's interests and values are represented by the assets within their crypto wallets. Creating a representation of one's societal / environmental impact within the wallet is a benefit of "Impact" tokens.

*The Impact Project enables NFT creators to mint an NFT with an environmental / social impact.*

### Use Cases 

Zora buys carbon-offset credits (https://decrypt.co/60271/zora-nft-carbon-offset-ethereum) and can prove their donation via "Impact" tokens. 

Collabs... say @trevorjonesart X https://water.org/ (promotes clean drinking water), the NFT is minted and up for sale. The buyers of the NFT receive a non-transferable "Impact" token. Wallets receive a report on the impact they had with the purchase of the artwork. 

User A donates 1 ETH to water.org and receives "Impact" tokens. User A can join a community to meet other users who value providing clean drinking water to less-fortunate individuals. 

### How It's Made

Creators can define their own rules with protocols such as Zora. Contracts can now include royalties that automatically donate to charities (represented by a smart contract that produces "Impact" tokens). Quality projects are the goal and being driven in the Ethereum ecosystem through projects like https://impactio.global/. 

*Avoid*
  - Charities that act as a black box (you don't know where your $1 donation gets allocated)
  - Platform specific solutions (make it platformless)
  - Trust

*Move Towards* 
  - Appealing to Gen Z and Millennial values
  - Incentivizing or nudging the donation to projects supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
  - Increasing the experience of donating to a charity by leveraging token-access communities 

### Thoughts

Social businesses (not profit-maximizing & and not reliant on donors/grants) are increasingly being spun up. 

*How can we support the most important global issues within the Ethereum ecosystem (future of the Creator DAO and leveraged in tokenized communities)?*
