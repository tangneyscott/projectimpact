A system to increase access to charities that are tackling one of the UN's sustainable development goals (https://sdgs.un.org/goals).

The current vision is this system could be "plugged-in" to a front-end of a popular marketplace. The system incentives individuals to contribute because you receive a nontransferable "social impact" token upon donation, offering a digital representation of your donation.
